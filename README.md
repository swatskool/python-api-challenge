  Following are the three trends that were observed during the analysis:
  1. In the Northern Hemisphere - the Latitude and the Maximum Temperature had a negative correlation. Which highlights if the latitude increases(goes towards the poles) temperature decreases.
  
  2. On the other hand in the southern Hemisphere the same relationship was a positive correlation. When the latitude increases the temperature increases.
  
  3. CLoudiness and Hunidity were factors which are largely related to moisture content and near by presence of water bodies hence there was no strong relationship which was observed when correlated with Latitude.
